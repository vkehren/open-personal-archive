  We created <a href="https://github.com/vkehren/open-personal-archive"><b>Open Personal Archive™</b></a> to address
  the pressing needs of Original Researchers of Primary Source Material as they perform research and prepare to use
  their research in publications. Such researchers commonly generate terabytes (TBs) of files while performing
  research activities, later facing the daunting challenge of sifting through this information to use it as evidence
  in publications via direct citations, while often wishing to retain control over who is allowed to actually access
  the underlying resources.
</p>
<p>
  To empower researchers to search, use, and cite their own research more effectively, we designed Open Personal
  Archive™ to offer the following benefits:
  <br />
  1. Real-time private archiving of media files (e.g. text, audio, video, images, etc.)
  <br />
  2. Flexible encoding of subject-specific searchable information
  <br />
  3. Advanced search functionality that empowers users to find specific resources quickly and intuitively using easy
  to understand search criteria and syntax
  <br />
  4. Seamless creation of publicly reviewable citations for use in publications, with the option to grant access to
  the underlying resources on a case-by-case basis
</p>
<p>
  To accomplish this, we built Open Personal Archive™ as an easily deployable Web Application built on the Google
  Firebase cloud development platform. This deployment model ensures that each researcher who uses Open Personal
  Archive™ has complete control over their own private deployment, including direct access to all uploaded content and
  files via their own Google Firebase management console that is tied to their own Google account.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to apply Open Personal Archive™ to your own research, you may simply download our code and deploy it to
  your own Google Firebase project (please see our <a href="./docs/InstallGuide.md"><b>Install Guide</b></a> for
  instructions as to how to do this).
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, if you wish to learn more about what Open Personal Archive™ is and how it works, please read our design
  documents:

  <br />
  2. <a href="./docs/VisualOverview.md"><b>Visual Overview</b></a>
  <br />
  3. <a href="./docs/FunctionalOverview.md"><b>Functional Overview</b></a>
</p>
<p>
  Finally, if you wish to adapt Open Personal Archive™ to better suit your own unique needs, you may do so, as well,
  under the flexible <a href="./LICENSE"><b>MIT License</b></a> under which we released our code. If you do so, we
  encourage you to share
  such changes with our team so that we may have the option to integrate your changes into the main code base for Open
  Personal Archive™.
