      "[INSERT_ALTERNATE_LEGAL_NAME]", "[INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME]", "[INSERT_ALTERNATE_ORGANIZATION_NAME]", "[INSERT_ORGANIZATION_URL]", "us" or "we" within this agreement.</p>
    <p>In the event that either side enters a claim or dispute against the other, these "Terms of Use" govern how such claims or disputes shall be resolved.</p>

    <p>By omitting reference to any specific matter, we do not waive any right or accept any limitation in regards to such matter.</p>
    <p>As our Services are currently in development, we do NOT guarantee any specific level of service in regards to the availability or performance of our Services, as our Services may cease or

    <p>In the event that [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] transitions to a new legal entity (or other type of organization), [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] is absorbed into another legal entity (or other type
      of organization), or the properties of [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] change ownership in any manner, we may assign this agreement for any reason and at our will, without the need to obtain any new
      consent from you (the other party).</p>
    <p>In the event that you use our Services on behalf of a business entity (or other type of organization), you affirm and guarantee that you are authorized to such usage on behalf of said business
      entity (or other type of organization), that said business entity (or other type of organization) agrees to these Terms of Use, and that any [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] User Account that is used
      to access or utilize our Services on behalf of said business entity (or other type of organization) remains owned and controlled by that business entity (or other type of organization).</p>
    <p>By using our website and/or services, you also confirm your agreement, as well as the agreement of any business entity (or other type of organization) that you interact on behalf of, to our
      Privacy Policy (see [INSERT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL]).</p>
