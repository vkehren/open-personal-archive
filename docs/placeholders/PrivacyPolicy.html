    <p>
    <h5>1. Introduction</h5>
    </p>
    <p>This policy, the [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] "Privacy Policy", describes what information is collected by our websites, tools, applications and services (referred to collectively as our
      "Services") and how we use that information.</p>
    <p>Your use of our Services confirms your agreement to our current "Privacy Policy", as well as the agreement of any business entity (or other type of organization) that you interact on behalf of.

    <p>We may at any time of our choosing update our "Privacy Policy" currently in effect by posting a new version of our "Privacy Policy" on our website. Your continued use of our Services confirms
      your agreement to such updates to our "Privacy Policy", as well as the agreement of any business entity (or other type of organization) that you interact on behalf of.</p>

    <p>
    <h5>2. Information that We Collect about ALL Users</h5>
    </p>
    <p>Currently, [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] provides a website (see [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_URL]) with a set of pages that are publicly accessible to all Users, whether they have registered for an
      account or not.</p>
    <p>For all such Users, [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] may record information such as IP Address, GPS location, type of web browser, which features are accessed, and other information useful for
      marketing, analytics, and/or other purposes.</p>
    <p>This information is kept private and only possibly shared outside [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] systems (which includes any cloud service providers who store and/or manage any of the
      [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] system data) in aggregate, such that no personally identifiable information is exposed.</p>

    <p>
    <h5>3. Information that We Collect about New Contacts</h5>
    </p>
    <p>To allow Users to request information about our Services, we provide a form at the [LOCATION_DESCRIPTION] of our [PAGE_NAME] (see [URL_OF_PAGE_NAME]) through which a User can submit their
      [DESCRIPTION_OF_INFO_SUBMITTED]. We refer to Users that submit such information as "Contacts".</p>
    <p>The [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] systems record and store this information for the purpose of contacting the Contact about answering their inquiry and/or possibly granting them access to our
      Services, in accordance with our Terms of Use (see [INSERT_TERMS_OF_USE_URL]).</p>
    <p>This information is kept private within the [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] systems (which includes any cloud service providers who store and/or manage any of the [INSERT_ORGANIZATION_NAME] system
      data).</p>

    <p>
    <h5>4. Statement about the Future</h5>
    </p>
    <p>As our Services are currently in development, we may need to change some or all of our Privacy Policy in the future.</p>
    <p>In making such changes, we will strive to maintain the privacy of our Users, while at the same time enhancing our Services.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, we reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy as our needs dictate, and your continued usage of our Services will confirm your agreement, as well as the agreement of
      any business entity (or other type of organization) that you interact on behalf of, to such changes.</p>
